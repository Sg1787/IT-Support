# 🧟‍♂️ Course 1: Technical Support Fundamentals  
## *“Data is the soul. Technology, its rotting vessel.”* — Nurgle (probably)

Hi! I’m Sadiyah 👋  
Before I automate cloud defenses or lock down AWS accounts, I need to understand **why IT matters**—not just as a job, but as a force that shapes how we live, learn, and connect.

##  What Is IT—Really?

To me, **IT is about turning raw data into something useful** using computers, networks, and software.  

It’s not just “fixing laptops.” It’s helping people *do their thing*—whether that’s a nurse accessing patient records, a student submitting homework, or my grandma sending memes.  

People in IT wear many hats:
- **Network engineers** keep data flowing like digital rivers.
- **Hardware techs** make sure machines don’t give up mid-task.
- **Desktop support** (like me, soon!) guide users through tech tantrums with patience.

##  Why IT Matters in Everyday Life

I’ve seen how IT quietly runs the world:
- **Schools** use it for online classes and grades.
- **Hospitals** rely on it for records and diagnostics.
- **Entertainment**? Every song, show, and silly cat video lives because of IT.

If someone can’t get online or use a device, they’re cut off—from jobs, care, even family. That hit me hard. Tech isn’t optional anymore. It’s essential.

##  Bridging the Digital Divide—My “Why”

Not everyone has a laptop, fast internet, or the confidence to click “OK” without fear. That gap is called the **digital divide**, and it’s often tied to money, location, or education.

But here’s what excites me:  
**I can help close that gap.**  

By learning IT, I’m not just building a career—I’m gaining the power to teach others, support my community, and maybe even inspire someone else to join this field. That feels meaningful.

##  My Chaos Take (Nurgle Style)

> *"Growth comes from decay. Understanding starts with listening."*

I used to think IT was all about speed and code. Now I see: **real support is slow, kind, and human**.  

Rebooting a printer might seem small—but if it lets a single mom file her taxes or a teen apply for college? That’s impact.  

And that’s why I’m starting here… before I summon bigger daemons in the cloud.
