#  Google IT Support Professional Certificate  
### *“From rot comes renewal. From troubleshooting, mastery.”* — Nurgle, probably  

Hi, I’m **Sadiyah Grobbler** 
While my heart beats for cloud security and serverless sorcery, even a daemon of decay knows: **all great architectures rise from solid foundations**.  

This repository documents my journey through the **Google IT Support Professional Certificate**—a foundational rite of passage for anyone entering the sacred halls of IT and cybersecurity. Think of it as tending to the garden before summoning the storm.  

Each course folder contains notes, key concepts, labs, and reflections—all explained like I’m teaching a fresh cultist (or a very tired intern).

##  Course Breakdown  

| Course | What It Teaches | Folder Link |
|--------|------------------|-------------|
| **1. Technical Support Fundamentals** | The sacred rites of IT helpdesk: how computers work, customer service with empathy, and why rebooting is the first prayer. | TBA |
| **2. Computer Networking** | How data flows like plague-spores through wires and air—TCP/IP, DNS, Wi-Fi, and the art of not letting packets get lost in the warp. | TBA |
| **3. Operating Systems and You** | Linux, Windows, and the eternal struggle of permissions, processes, and package managers. Nurgle smiles upon those who `chmod` wisely. | TBA |
| **4. System Administration and IT Infrastructure Services** | Building resilient systems that *don’t* crumble like mortal flesh—user management, cloud basics, and automation rituals. | TBA |
| **5. IT Security: Defense Against the Digital Dark Arts** | Firewalls, encryption, phishing demons, and how to armor your systems against the heresies of cyber chaos. | TBA |
| **6. IT Automation with Python** | Replace repetitive toil with scripts that slither like Nurglings—automate everything, so you can focus on higher corruption… I mean, *innovation*. | TBA |

##  Why This Matters (Even for a Future Security Engineer)  

Before you lock down AWS VPCs or write Lambda functions that banish threats, you must **understand the machine beneath**.  
- Networking? That’s your battlefield.  
- OS internals? Your armor.  
- Automation? Your plague-bearing flies.  

This cert isn’t just “support”—it’s the **rot that fertilizes the garden of expertise**.
